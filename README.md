# Email Address Validator
## ActiveModel-style email address format validator

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/substancelab/activemodel-email_address_validator/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/substancelab/activemodel-email_address_validator) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/substancelab/activemodel-email_address_validator/badge.svg?branch=more-badges&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/substancelab/activemodel-email_address_validator?branch=more-badges)

Whenever I have wanted to validate an email address it has been because I wanted to be somewhat certain I can send an email to someone. Usually this happens as part of a signup procedure.

At this point I have pretty much one criteria:

* Don't reject a valid email address realistically in use by a potential user. Err on the side of accepting too much.

Quite frankly, I don't care about the RFC at this point, neither does the user. I care that my users can enter their email address and get on with using my product. I appreciate it if the application catches any misspellings of their email addresses, though - this is the opportune moment for them to correct it.

## Requirements

* Should not accept local email addresses: No user ever needed to sign up using `"postmaster@localhost"` or `"bob@1.2.3.4"` even though they are perfectly valid email addresses.
* Must work with I18n like Rails' built-in validators do. If not configured otherwise, the default translation key must be `:invalid`.

## Usage examples

### Simplest case

    validates :email, :email_address => true

### Bring your own logic

If the default behavior isn't enough for you, you can include a custom rule for email addresses. For example to match the email addresses against a regular expression:

    validates :email, :email_address => {:with => /.+@.+\..+/}

Or you could go beyound simple matching and validate that all email adresses belong to the same company:

    validates :email, :email_address => {
      :with => proc { |address| address.end_with?("@substancelab.com") }
    }

You can even match against multiple rules, in which case all rules must pass:

    validates :email, :email_address => {
      :with => [
        proc { |address| address.match(/.+@.+\..+/) },
        proc { |address| !address.end_with?("@outlook.com") },
      ]
    }

Do note that supplying your own rules means that the default email address validation isn't run - you're on your own, basically.

### Verify domain (still to be done - pull request, anybody?)

This also checks that the domain actually has an MX record. Note this might take a while because of DNS lookups.

    validates :email, :email_address => {:mx => true}

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'activemodel-email_address_validator'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install activemodel-email_address_validator
